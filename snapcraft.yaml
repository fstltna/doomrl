name:  doomrl
title:  Doom - The Roguelike
version: "0.9.9.7"
summary:  DRL (formerly DoomRL) is a roguelike video game
description: |
  DRL is turn-based, offers a top-down interface formed entirely of ASCII characters, and features a character leveling system with traits. As it is based upon Doom, the game is more fast-paced and combat-oriented than usual for a roguelike, and relies heavily on ranged rather than melee combat. A limited player inventory, non-stackable items, and other design choices contrast with the often extreme intricacy of games in its genre.
